      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a software developer specializing in JavaScript, React, CSS, Node.js and systems design. I am passionate about building user-friendly applications and designing aesthetic user interfaces.</p>
      <p>I've previously worked as a Senior Quality Analyst for the Monetization Support Team at Meta.
      I've always envisioned developing more technical skills at some point during my career; my experience at Meta inspired me to pursue software engineering so that I can solve more complex problems and leave a bigger impact on the industry.</p>
      <p>When I'm not programming, I enjoy discovering new music, watching esports and reading about completely random topics on Wikpedia. I also coach a competitive VALORANT team in my free time.</p>
